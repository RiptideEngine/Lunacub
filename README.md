<h1 align="center">Lunacub</h1>

Lunacub is an API designed to simplify the process of building and importing external resources during application runtime.

Always built with latest .NET version (currently .NET 9.0).

## License

Lunacub is licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 3, see [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html#license-text) for more details.

## Documentation

- There is currently no plan to make a documentation website, but you can see some usage example in the [example](/examples) directory.

## Manual building

You can manually build Lunacub with your own .NET environment. There is no plan to support older .NET version, so .NET 9.0 is a must for the time being.

To clone Lunacub locally, run one of these 2 following git commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RiptideEngine/Lunacub.git
```
or
```bash
git clone git@github.com:RiptideEngine/Lunacub.git
```

If you are on Windows, you can optionally enable long file paths in git (run as Administrator):
